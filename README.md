# theme-bobthefish-colorschemes
A set of custom color schemes for the inimitable Bob the Fish theme.

This could be a bunch of custom themes, or end up just being the Monokai one.  This should be a foundation to work off of for anyone wanting the massive functionality Bob the Fish gives us while also craving a specific aesthetic sensibility, and the ability to share this with others.

TODO
----

Future work includes rendering all the custom themes programmatically and including screenshots here in the readme.
